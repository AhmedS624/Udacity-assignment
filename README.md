# Landing Page Project

## How it works
The project has 4 sections and a navbar to navigate through them .

>also the navbar's opacity decreses on larger devices while not in use.

the window has a Event listener for scroll then updates the navbar element related to the section being displayed on the screen.

>using some css the page is responsive on big and smaller devices.
